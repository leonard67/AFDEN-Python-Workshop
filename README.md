**Welcome to AFDEN Python Workship for Accounting and Finance Research**

## 0. Python Environment Setup

Before our first session, please follow the steps below to set up the required Python environment on your computer.

    The python version we use is 3.12, and the IDE I will use for demostration is VS Code. If you prefer other IDEs such as PyCharm or jupyter notebook, you are welcome to use the one you are familar with.

    I set up the python environment using `uv`, which is fast and easy for begginers. If you have already known how to use `pip` or `conda` to set up your Python virtual environment, you can use your preferred method and ignore the following steps. Just make sure you have installed all the packages in [requirements file](./requirements.txt).

1. **Install `uv`**: See https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/
    - If you are using Windows: open Command Prompt, type `winget install --id=astral-sh.uv  -e`
    - If you are using Mac OS: open Terminal, type `wget -qO- https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh`
    - To check if `uv` is successfully installed, type `uv --version`
2. **Install VS Code** from https://code.visualstudio.com. In VS Code, Install the following Extensions (one the left column):
   - Data Wrangler
   - Jupyter
   - Python
3. Download this Github repository to your local disk.   
   - Click the  green "<> Code" button and click "Download ZIP".
   - Create a new folder on your computer and extra the ZIP file in that directory
   - Open the directory using VS Code (or your IDE). In Terminal, run `uv sync`.
